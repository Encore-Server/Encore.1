delete-after: True

# Any changes you've made.  See valid prefix list above.
# INDENT WITH TWO SPACES.  NOT TABS.  SPACES.
# SCREW THIS UP AND IT WON'T WORK.
# Also, this gets changed to [] after reading.  Just remove the brackets when you add new shit.
# Please surround your changes in  double quotes ("). It works without them, but if you use certain characters it screws up compiling. The quotes will not show up in the changelog.
changes:
  - rscadd: "Increases the amount of produce around town. The Inn backroom starts stocked a little better, especially with more grain. The Keep has received a similar buff, with a slight edge over the commonfolk in the form of a fruit crate in the basement with apples and jacksberries. The windmill also has grain and flour in it."
  - rscadd: "Adds a small cow and chicken pen to the Keep, plus some farming supplies for a tiny garden. No seeds though."
  - rscadd: "Adds two chickens to the public cow pen."
