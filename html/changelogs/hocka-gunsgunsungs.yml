changes:
  - rscadd: "Added muskets to the game - as well as the gunpowder horn, required for priming it. Iron shots (and shot pouches to carry them in more conveniently) have of course also been added - the musketeer virtue and Cudao Marksman mercenary subclass spawn with these items. They can also be crafted, bought from the merchant, or found in the town watch's armoury."
  - rscadd: "Musketeer Virtue - gives you a little bit of firearms skill and gives you a musket kit in your stash."
  - rscadd: "Cudao Marksman mercenary subclass - basically a class dedicated to using the newly added musket (and other firearms down the line, most likely.)"
  - rscadd: "Added the firearms skill - this skill impacts how quickly you pack your musket's gunpowder and how quickly you can get a perfect aim with firearms."
  - imageadd: "Added sprites for the gunpowder horn, shot pouch and musket, made by Lancer."
  - maptweak: "Added three muskets and the equipment needed to operate them to the garrison armoury."
  - soundadd: "Added musket firing sound, dry firing sound, pan opening/closing sound, musket barrel ram-rodding sound. Also added combat music for the Cudao Marksman."
  - refactor: "Fixed the colour on the 'red' font define to look a bit more appropriate compared to the rest of the game, mimicking red text from other areas."
  - refactor: "Refactoed how gun code handles removing rounds from a gun, so that the bullet goes straight to your inactive hand (if it's empty) - this should also affect bows and crossbows!"
  - refactor: "Added a special variety of the smoke effect specifically for powder gun blasts."
