2025-05-03:
  ClemTheDuck:
  - bugfix: fixes a small bug that saw the hood item not selectable in the loadout.
  CometBlaze:
  - bugfix: Fixes the Night-Eyed virtue so it now does what it's supposed to.
  Furrycactus:
  - rscadd: Adds a new Warden subclass - the Panther Warden. While still Ranger-types,
      they lean a little more in the direction of Rogue, adding more versatility to
      the job.
  - rscadd: Drastically overhauls the skills granted to Acolytes, and makes Acolytes
      of each Patron distinct from each other.
  - rscadd: Makes some small fixes to the new minining tunnels dungeon.
  - rscadd: Makes some tweaks to the Fort Hellwatch templates so it's hopefully less
      uber-death-kill now.
  - rscadd: Fixes the item path for the lockpick ring granted by the Petty Thief virtue.
  - rscadd: Reflavours several Roguetown alcoholic drinks to be more in line with
      our setting.
  - rscadd: Adds Consecrated and Cursed wine.
  - rscadd: Adds markers for randomised barrels of alcohol to spawn, and puts them
      across the map.
  - qol: Increases the Heir skill in Swords to Journeyman.
  - qol: Reduces the Heir skill in Maces to Apprentice.
  - rscadd: Adds a small network of old mining tunnels to the south-east of Old Doma,
      and north of the Lakeside Hamlet. Baby's first dungeon, plus a place you can
      go mining if you want.
  - rscadd: Adds three new tracks to the game. One for the Shirleigh Keep, one for
      the spooky or abandoned villages (Lodge Berkleigh, Lakeside Hamlet, Wey Whisperen),
      and one combat theme for Church militant roles.
  - rscadd: Added some levels in Druidic Trickery for Gani and Secret God patron Clerics
      and Witches. Some subclasses offer more skills than others.
  Hocka:
  - bugfix: Uncommented some of the shuttle code to allow merchant-type machines to
      work.
  - rscadd: Replaced a chair with a dye station on the spawn boat.
  - bugfix: Added stab intent to stone knives, letting them be used for cooking meat
      over a campfire.
  - rscadd: Added a new salt water subtype for the water reagent - drinking it lowers
      hydrations but it can be filtered by purifier waterskins. If you gather a full
      pot of it you can boil it to get the salt out.
  - rscadd: 'New crafting recipe, mostly a side-fix for transferring the chemical
      reagent version of salt into the salt pile item, needed for cooking recipes. '
  - balance: The salt alchemy recipe now outputs 3 piles of salt instead of one to
      hopefully keep it competitive with the new source of salt.
  - qol: Clicking on a tree trunk with either a stone axe or woodcutting axe on chop
      intent will now automatically cycle through the hits for you, much like blacksmithing.
  - rscadd: Direct Narrate, Global Narrate and Local Narrate now lets you choose the
      size, colour and shape of the text it outputs.
  - refactor: Added a bunch of defines such as FONT_TINY(), FONT_BRIGHTRED() etc to
      serve as an alternative to spans, this was mostly to make the changes to narrate
      a bit more readable but it should be nice to take advantage of in the future,
      with far less arbitraty names than the span defines.
  - bugfix: Arcyne Potential now assigns Prestidigitation regardless of the recipient's
      arcane skill level.
  - rscadd: Rearranged the proc for Arcyne Potential a bit for more readability, and
      so that it actually gives out Prestidigitation like it's supposed to.
  kyres1:
  - rscadd: Added a method for admins to roll dice using a Roll Global Dice verb in
      the Admin tab.
  - rscadd: Added a tutorial area accessible from the roundstart spawn where people
      can learn the game safely.
  - bugfix: Tidies up a lot of turf smoothing problems.
2025-05-09:
  Furrycactus:
  - rscadd: Tweaks Fort Hellwatch some more, again. Removes the hell trolls, places
      mob-spawn traps instead that hopefully aren't going to cause more cases of monsters
      fighting each other.
  kyres1:
  - rscadd: The pillar of bodies will scream now.
  - rscadd: Adds ents, big tree mobs that are kinda scary but don't attack if you
      don't get close.
  - rscadd: Adds more flowers to the world generators for the Weeping Wood and the
      County of Etgard because they looked kinda dull before.
  - rscadd: Adjusted fiend behavior. Stationary fiends shouldn't move anymore, and
      chargers will actually charge you at ludicrous speeds.
  - rscdel: Removed random maneater spawns from all areas, and mapped in maneaters
      are all gone now.
  - bugfix: Fixes upgraded fire dancers not having functioning projectiles.
  - bugfix: Fixes more double turf map errors in Mount Miracle.
  - bugfix: Fixes lava runtimes by disabling unused Hell templates.
  - rscadd: Adds a verb to spawn checkpoints. To be used in events to give players
      an alternative method to depart long dungeons, as well as an OOC safe zone.
      It is located in the admin tab.
