changes:
  - bugfix: "Added stab intent to stone knives, letting them be used for cooking meat over a campfire."
  - rscadd: "Added a new salt water subtype for the water reagent - drinking it lowers hydrations but it can be filtered by purifier waterskins. If you gather a full pot of it you can boil it to get the salt out."
  - rscadd: "New crafting recipe, mostly a side-fix for transferring the chemical reagent version of salt into the salt pile item, needed for cooking recipes. "
  - balance: "The salt alchemy recipe now outputs 3 piles of salt instead of one to hopefully keep it competitive with the new source of salt."
  - qol: "Clicking on a tree trunk with either a stone axe or woodcutting axe on chop intent will now automatically cycle through the hits for you, much like blacksmithing."
