  : - rscadd: Removes the requirement of a table for repairing cloth or leather armour.
  Doxxmedearly:
  - rscadd: Extends time between vomit checks, reduces nausea more when vomiting,
      and adds a constitution check to hold back from vomiting, if your constitution
      is 11 or higher.
  - rscadd: Reduces how much nausea rot gives you per life tick.
  Doxxmedearly, Furrycactus:
  - rscadd: Fixes classes not getting psicrosses for Goler Kanh and Iliope.

      in place if we want spells restricted in the future.
  - code_imp: Tidies up psicross equipping on job selection.
  - rscadd: Adds craftable wooden holy amulets.
  - imageadd: Adds new sprites for wooden amulets, courtesy of Furrycactus (Joshie).
  Furrycactus:
  - rscadd: Unlocks the Inn backroom. It can still be locked if an Innkeeper character
      decides to, but they're so rare they might as well not exist. If I had a dollar
      for every time the door got broken down I'd have more money than the One Envy.
  - rscadd: Adds small and large banners for the Elementals and All-Aspect.
  - rscadd: Adds musical instruments to the loadout.
  - rscadd: Twig floors can now be built on any solid form of turf, not only on dirt/grass
      derivatives.
  - rscadd: Swaps around the Borrowed Time and Abrogation miracles for Mjallidhorn
      clergy, so Templars of Mjallidhorn can actually use the Undead-hunter spell,
      while only Clerics and Priests can make use of the more healing-oriented spell.
  - rscadd: Adds three new Warden subclasses - Hawk, Wolf, and Bear for Ranged, Balanced,
      and Melee combat specialisation respectively.
  - rscadd: Gives Wardens an Apprentice level in Skincrafting, since they're Ranger
      types.
  - rscadd: Nerfs the Bog Master somewhat, replacing their Steel gear with Iron (kyres
      request), renames it to Wild Master, and dropps their Master level wrestling
      to Expert.
  - rscadd: Adds serfstones to several more Garrison and Nobility roles. Basically
      any military related job.
  - rscadd: Spider Honey is now a guaranteed drop when you butcher Beespiders.

      and Fire tabards.

  - rscadd: Moved the Iliope tabard from the Mjallidhorn chest to the Akan chest.
  - rscadd: Mapped in the alt Helmet of Visires to the Visires chest.
  - rscadd: An ill wind blows from Fort Hellwatch, coming from the direction of Mount
      Miracle.
  - rscadd: Adds two new weapons to Templar weapon selection - the Zweihander and
      the Lucerne, a greatsword and a polearm. Being large weapons, this means a Templar
      that selects them will have to forego their kite shield entirely to use them
      effectively.
  - rscadd: Added a clock to the spawn boat. Finally you can collect your loadout
      item before leaving.
  - rscadd: Gives Half-Elves more lore-compliant skin tone selection instead of Azure
      Peak ones, and allows them to pick any of the selections available to Humans
      or Elves.
  - rscadd: Remaps the Church and Mage Tower.
  - rscadd: Adds a crafting recipe for the dark wood walls variant.
  - rscadd: Removes the item requirements on the Eyebite and Conjure Web spells, as
      Heretical God followers were almost entirely unable to aquire the necessary
      items to use them (necromancer robes, psycross).
  - rscadd: Correctly sets a Templar's skill level with Polearms to the bumped up
      level it's supposed to be if selected.
  - rscadd: Adds the current weapon selection that Templar has to Adjudicator.
  - rscadd: Adds some T1-4 spells for the All-Aspect, even though anything beyond
      T1 is redundant.
  - rscadd: Swaps out some generic psycrosses for proper silver psycrosses, both on
      the map and on some Inquisition roles.
  - rscadd: Gives proper Inquisition keyrings to the Orthodoxist roles, otherwise
      they can't actually unlock the churchling quarters.
  - rscadd: Adds a new large dungeon to Southern Domotan, just north of where the
      Seculton Gate will be.
  - rscadd: Seals off the lava tube into Hell from Mount Miracle for now.

      weird ones with faces.
  - rscadd: Added an additional check to make sure bait cannot be used inside the
      town of Doma itself.

      so it isn't permanently lost if they have something in their hand already.

  - rscadd: Renamed the original bait recipe to 'bait (wheat)'

  doxxmedearly:
  - rscadd: Automated stockpiler now accepts fish as a bounty.
  - rscadd: Campfires, ovens, and hearths that burn long enough now produce ash. This
      can be removed when the fire is out by clicking it with an empty hand.
  - rscadd: Slightly reworded descriptions when examining fires that are not lit with
      regard to their remaining fuel.
  - rscadd: You have a little more time to warm your hands over a brazier before it
      burns you.
  - rscadd: Adds peg legs and bronze prosthetic legs, with crafting recipes and surgery
      steps.
  - rscadd: Peg legs provide a slight slowdown, bronze legs do not. Both make you
      more likely to leave tracks.
  - rscadd: Adds the option to start with a peg leg as a vice.
  - code_imp: Cleans up code for prosthetics as a vice, adds helper procs, adds flexible
      icon_state setting for prosthetics.

  - rscadd: Mudcrabs and muckcrabs can be caught while fishing.
  - rscadd: Added a way to safely kill crabs, if you have something that can stab.
      Grab them and use the item on them, but be careful!
  - rscadd: Rods can be de-baited with right click.
  - rscadd: Added restrictions to water that can contain fish. Shouldn't affect the
      current map, but good for the future.
  - rscdel: Removed the buggy worm-gathering feature.
  - bugfix: Mudcrabs can actually do damage now.
  - bugfix: Fixed weird behavior with bait stacking and separating stacks of bait.
      Should work better now.
  - rscadd: Added craftable bone arrows and needles. Bone arrows are similar to stone,
      but cooler. Bone needles are better than thorn but also require a knife to craft.
  - rscadd: Thorn needles now have less integrity than their metal cousins.
  - bugfix: Equipping headgear or masks to your hip slot no longer hides your hair,
      face, or ears.

      of their tiered ones.

      is priest-only.
  - bugfix: Clerics and Templars of Gani have access to fortify once more.
  hocka:
  - rscadd: Added the Ranger-Zealot and Scout-Templar subclasses to Templar, a heavier
      unit with access to a steel shortsword and a longbow/crossbow and a lighter
      unit that foregoes a sword at all respectively, in exchange for more muted skills
      and less carrying capacity.
  - rscadd: Added a subtype of the black leather belts to allow Scout-Templars and
      Ranger-Zealots to spawn with the church keyring in their belt, on account of
      their drastically lowered free inventory spots.
  - rscadd: Added the Ranger-Knight subclass to Ranger (adventurer), essentially a
      copy of the Ranger-Zealot but without access to Miracles and is able to choose
      between a Recurve, Longbow or Crossbow.
  - rscadd: Shuffled around the vars for determining the pants that are equipped on
      all subclasses of Ranger (adventurer), mostly for the benefit of the Ranger-Knight's
      slightly heavy armour set.
  - rscadd: Reworded 'lux' to 'thauma' in the transfusion surgery text prompts.
  - rscadd: Changed the name of the 'lux' item to 'thauma'.
