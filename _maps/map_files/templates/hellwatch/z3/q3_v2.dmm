Should the Seculton Gate give way, or should Hell resume its march, we will answer the call of the Royal House once more and lend our aid. Whatever petty political differences there may be, Hell is bigger than all of us. We must remember this. Hell cannot win. It must not."

Perhaps now is not the time to wax poetic, but I believe I'm not sure what awaits me after this. For so long I've led these Templars against the tides of Hell. Still, there are more places in the Goblet to serve. I've taken stock of our supplies and left an acceptable amount, should the fortress need to be re-manned. I've sealed the Armoury, and will take the key with me. The last thing the countryside needs is a group of bandits raiding this place and making off with the equipment that we wielded righteously against Hell's fires. Finally, I spoke with the cleric of Visires before they were dismissed. The underground tunnel to our holdings in Mount Miracle proper has been collapsed, utterly. There should be no threat of daemonic forces coming through it, not unless - Elementals forbid - they manage to amass in frightening numbers within Mount Miracle..."
