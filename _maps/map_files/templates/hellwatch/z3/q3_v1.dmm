Still, there are more places in the Goblet to serve. I've taken stock of our supplies and left an acceptable amount, should the fortress need to be re-manned. I've sealed the Armoury, and will take the key with me. The last thing the countryside needs is a group of bandits raiding this place and making off with the equipment that we wielded righteously against Hell's fires. Finally, I spoke with the cleric of Visires before they were dismissed. The underground tunnel to our holdings in Mount Miracle proper has been collapsed, utterly. There should be no threat of daemonic forces coming through it, not unless - Elementals forbid - they manage to amass in frightening numbers within Mount Miracle..."

Should the Seculton Gate give way, or should Hell resume its march, we will answer the call of the Royal House once more and lend our aid.
