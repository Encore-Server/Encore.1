		Psydon sent down the COMET SYON to destroy the rampaging Archdevils that threatened our lands as proof of His divinity, whilst the Ten cowered and hid!\n\.\n\
		Unanswered prayers, impotent miracles... These are mere tests. Our faith in Him is all we need. Psydon is not dead; he merely slumbers."
